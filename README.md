# Travel-Helper
 Travel Helper Milestone project #2

This project will help travellers find useful and good places in diffrent countries and cities
 
## UX
 
The user can click on one of the sections in the nav bar and the page will smoothly go down to this section, this is done for convenience, so as not to switch between pages.

Make the site in dark and light colors, as it does not strain the eyes and the user can use it comfortably.

Also, due to the fact that there is now a trend in design for rounded objects, they are taken as a basis in the site.

## Features

In the first section, we see the developer's icon, his name and role.

Further going down below you can see the work that he performed, for more detailed information.

In the third section, we can read more detailed information about the developer. Since there is written a few words about yourself and download his resume.

In the last section there is a contact form for contacting developers on any issues.

In the footer of the site, you can see the address of the developer's residence, you can also see social networks
and take a look at the resume
